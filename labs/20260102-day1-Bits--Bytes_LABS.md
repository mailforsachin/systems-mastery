# Bits & Bytes — LABS

## ONLY WHEN YOU EXPERIMENT

Create a lab **only if** you actually test something.

### Examples
- Change a config
- Break something on purpose
- Compare behaviors
- Measure performance

### Each lab answers:
- What did I try?
- What did I expect?
- What actually happened?
- What surprised me?
