# Bits & Bytes — CONCEPTS

## ONLY WHEN A PATTERN EMERGES

Create a concept **only if** you notice this thought:

> “Ah… this keeps coming up.”

### Triggers
- You’ve written about this 3–4 times
- You keep explaining it to yourself
- It finally feels *stable*

### Goal
A calm, reusable explanation future-you can rely on.
