# Bits & Bytes — CONCEPTS

## ONLY WHEN A PATTERN EMERGES

Create a concept **only if** you notice this thought:

>🚕 Taxi analogy (most reliable)

Packet = passenger

Frame = taxi

At every hop:

Passenger gets out

Taxi is destroyed

Passenger enters a new taxi

The passenger never wraps the taxi.
The taxi always wraps the passenger.

### Triggers
- You’ve written about this 3–4 times
- You keep explaining it to yourself
- It finally feels *stable*

### Goal
A calm, reusable explanation future-you can rely on.
