# Bits & Bytes — CONCEPTS

## ONLY WHEN A PATTERN EMERGES

Create a concept **only if** you notice this thought:

>🚕 Taxi analogy (most reliable)
Packet = passenger
Frame = taxi
At every hop:
Passenger gets out
Taxi is destroyed
Passenger enters a new taxi
The passenger never wraps the taxi.
The taxi always wraps the passenger.

Layer 2 (Frame)
Uses MAC addresses
Used within a LAN
Switches read it
Contains the Layer 3 packet
Has preamble, MACs, EtherType, FCS

Layer 3 (Packet)
Uses IP addresses
Used across networks
Routers read it
Contains the Layer 4 segment
Has IP header fields like TTL, protocol, fragmentation

### Triggers
- You’ve written about this 3–4 times
- You keep explaining it to yourself
- It finally feels *stable*

### Goal
A calm, reusable explanation future-you can rely on.
